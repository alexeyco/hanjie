"Paint-By-Number" is one of many names for a type of graphical logic puzzle originating in Japan. 
Other common names for these puzzles are Nonograms, Griddlers, Hanjie, and Picross.

In surveying these, Jan Wolter noticed a lack of a good, standardized file format for paint-by-number puzzles. 
Every program seems to invent it's own file format. [So he decided to come up with an XML file format that would be rich 
enough to handle most puzzle-storing applications](https://webpbn.com/pbn_fmt.html).

_We all understand perfectly well that XML is not very fun, so I decided to come up with a YAML-based file format 
that stylish, trendy and youthful. Bazinga!_
